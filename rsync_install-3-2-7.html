<h1>Instructions for use of Rsync versions 3.2.7 and above with SSL</h1>
<p>Use the OSS command<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>tar xzf rsync-<i>package</i>.tar.gz -C / -p --no-same-owner</code><br/>
to install rsync. Make sure to have the directory containing the OpenSSL 3.1.x,
3.0.x, 1.1.x, or 1.0.2u version of libcrypt.so and libssl.so in your
_RLD_LIB_PATH or _RLD_FIRST_LIB_PATH variable when rsync is used.</p>
<p>If you are running on J-series, you must also include /usr/coreutils/lib
in your RLD configuration.</p>
<p><b>Note: </b>This package installs in a fixed path to ensure separation
from incompatible SSL instances.
<p>
Due to new features added in the latest OSS System Libraries, binaries built
with those will not function correctly on older RVUs.   The following table
lists the minimum RVU for each platform that can correctly run git
version 3.2.7, and above:</p>
<table>
<tr>
  <td><b>Platform</b></td>
  <td><b>Minimum RVU</b></td>
</tr>
  <td>TNS/E</td>
  <td>J06.21</td>
<tr>
  <td>TNS/X</td>
  <td>L17.08</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>TNS/V</td>
  <td>L17.08</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>If you require new features or bug fixes that were released after 3.2.7,
you will have to download the source package and build the new version
yourself.  This requires experience with FLOSS and with building open source
tools on OSS.</p>
