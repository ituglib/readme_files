<h1>Instructions for use of nano versions 8.3 and above</h1>
<p>Use the OSS command<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>tar xzf nano-<i>package</i>.tar.gz -C / -p --no-same-owner</code><br/>
to install nano.</p>
<p>
If you are using the wide (nanow) version, you must use the ncurses_32 package
from ITUGLIB for the <code>libncursesw.so</code> DLL. For the standard version, only
CoreUtils (T1202) is required. This may change over time.</p>
<p>
Due to new features added in the latest OSS System Libraries, binaries built
with those will not function correctly on older RVUs.   The following table
lists the minimum RVU for each platform that can correctly run nano
version 8.3, and above:</p>
<table>
<tr>
  <td><b>Platform</b></td>
  <td><b>Minimum RVU</b></td>
</tr>
  <td>TNS/E</td>
  <td>J06.21</td>
<tr>
  <td>TNS/X</td>
  <td>L17.08</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>TNS/X - wide character</td>
  <td>L20.10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>TNS/V</td>
  <td>L17.08</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>TNS/V - wide character</td>
  <td>L20.10</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>If you require new features or bug fixes that were released after 8.3,
you will have to download the source package and build the new version
yourself.  This requires experience with FLOSS and with building open source
tools on OSS.</p>
<p>If you don't need these new features you should continue to use version 8.3 instead of the latest version.</p>
