<h1>Instructions for use of git versions 2.51.0 and above</h1>
<p>Use the OSS command<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>tar xzf git-<i>package</i>.tar.gz -C /usr/local -p --no-same-owner</code><br/>
to install git. Make sure to have the directory containing the appropriate OpenSSL 
version of libcrypt.so in your _RLD_LIB_PATH variable when git is used.</p>
<p>
Due to new features added in the latest OSS System Libraries, binaries built
with those will not function correctly on older RVUs.   The following table
lists the minimum RVU for each platform that can correctly run git
version 2.51.0, and above:</p>

  <td valign='top'>Jenkins 2.356 is not fully compatible with git 2.51.0 and above.
      The Git Client Jenkins plugin uses the <code>git whatchanged</code> command,
      which was deprecated as of git 2.51.0 and will be removed at git 3.0.
      This results in the Jenkins changelog being unavailable and in some
      cases may fail. Users are cautioned to be aware of this and potentially
      have a separate dedicated git instance for Jenkins use on J-series.<br/>
      The ref-table command has some unknown issues on J-series as of 2.51.0.
      Use caution with this command.</td>

<p>If you require new features or bug fixes that were released after 2.51.0,
you will have to download the source package and build the new version
yourself.  This requires experience with FLOSS and with building open source
tools on OSS.</p>
<p>If you don't need these new features you should continue to use version 2.51.0 instead of the latest version.</p>
