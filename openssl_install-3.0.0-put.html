<h1>Instructions for use of OpenSSL 3.0.0 (PUT Library)</h1>
<p><b>Caution: OpenSSL 3.0.0 is in a BETA state. Do not use in production.</b></
p>
<p>Use the OSS command<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>tar xzf openssl-<i>package</i>.tar.gz -C / -p --no-same-user</code><br/>
to install OpenSSL. You must install the package in the exact same location as
in the tar file. Add the <code>/usr/local-ssl3.0_put/lib</code> to your _RLD_LIB_PATH variable when
OpenSSL 3.0.0 PUT is needed. Other versions of OpenSSL should be installed
elsewhere.</p>
<p>
Due to new features added in the latest OSS System Libraries, binaries built
with those will not function correctly on older RVUs.   The following table
lists the minimum RVU for each platform that can correctly run OpenSSL
version 3.0.0, and above:</p>
<table>
<tr>
  <td><b>Platform</b></td>
  <td><b>Minimum RVU</b></td>
</tr>
  <td>TNS/E</td>
  <td>J06.22</td>
<tr>
  <td>TNS/X</td>
  <td>L19.08</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>TNS/V</td>
  <td>L19.08</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p><b>Caution: </b>Do not mix versions of OpenSSL. There is no binary
compatibility between version 1.1.1 and 3.0.0 of OpenSSL. The first directory
encountered in _RLD_LIB_PATH is selected by the OSS loader. Do not use a
threaded library with an unthreaded program and vice versa.</p>
