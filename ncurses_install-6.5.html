<h1>Instructions for use of ncurses versions 6.5 and above</h1>
<p>Use the OSS command<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>tar xzf ncurses<i>package</i>.tar.gz -C / -p --no-same-owner</code><br/>
to install ncurses. If you are using the ncurses DLLs, make sure to have the directory containing the appropriate
DLL in your _RLD_LIB_PATH variable when ncurses is used. Typically,
this is <code>/usr/local/lib</code> or <code>/usr/local/lib64</code>.</p>
<p>
If you are building 64-bit ncurses yourself, you will need the c11 compiler
and a minimum RVU of L20.10. Fix any compile errors that occur. You may have
issues in configure with <code>intptr_t</code> and in <code>search.h</code>.
<p>
Due to new features added in the latest OSS System Libraries, binaries built
with those will may not function correctly on older RVUs.  The following table
lists the minimum RVU for each platform that can correctly run ncurses
version 6.5, and above:</p>
<table>
<tr>
  <td><b>Platform</b></td>
  <td><b>Minimum RVU</b></td>

  <td>TNS/E</td>
  <td>not available from ITUGLIB</td>

  <td>L20.10</td>
