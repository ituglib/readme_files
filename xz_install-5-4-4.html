<h1>Instructions for use of Xz versions 5.4.4 and above</h1>
<p>Use the OSS command<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>tar xzf xz-<i>package</i>.tar.gz -C / -p --no-same-owner</code><br/>
to install xz.</p>
<p>
Due to new features added in the latest OSS System Libraries, binaries built
with those will not function correctly on older RVUs.   The following table
lists the minimum RVU for each platform that can correctly use xz
version 5.4.4, and above:</p>
<table>
<tr>
  <td><b>Platform</b></td>
  <td><b>Minimum RVU</b></td>
</tr>
  <td>TNS/E</td>
  <td>J06.21</td>
<tr>
  <td>TNS/X</td>
  <td>L17.08</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>TNS/V</td>
  <td>L17.08</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>If you require new features or bug fixes that were released after 5.4.4,
you will have to download the source from the xz download and build the new
version yourself. This requires experience with FLOSS and with building open
source tools on OSS. Make sure to replace the line in <code>src/xz/file_io.c</code> that includes <code>poll.h</code> with the following:</p>
<pre>
<s>#include &lt;poll.h&gt;</s>
#define _FLOSS_USE_POLL
#include &lt;floss.h(floss_poll)&gt;
</pre>
