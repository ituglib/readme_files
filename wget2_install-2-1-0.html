<h1>Instructions for use of wget2 versions 2.1.0 and above with OpenSSL 3.0+</h1>
<p>Use the OSS command<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>tar xzf wget2-<i>package</i>.tar.gz -C / -p --no-same-owner</code><br/>
to install wget2. Make sure to have the directory containing the OpenSSL 3.0.x
version of OpenSSL in your _RLD_LIB_PATH variable when wget2 is used. Typically,
this is <code>/usr/local-ssl3.0/lib</code>.</p>
<p>You can build wget2 with other versions of OpenSSL. Make sure to change the
various settings appropriately to reference the library area of OpenSSL.</p>
<p>
Due to new features added in the latest OSS System Libraries, binaries built
with those will may not function correctly on older RVUs.  The following table
lists the minimum RVU for each platform that can correctly run wget2
version 2.1.0, and above:</p>
<table>
<tr>
  <td><b>Platform</b></td>
  <td><b>Minimum RVU</b></td>
</tr>
  <td>TNS/E</td>
  <td>Not supported</td>
<tr>
  <td>TNS/X</td>
  <td>L23.08</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>TNS/V</td>
  <td>L23.08</td>
</tr>

<h2>Build Recipe</h2>
<p>As of 2.1.0, wget2 requires the libpsl package. Please download and install it
from ITUGLIB prior to attempting to build wget2.</p>
<p>To build wget2 from source, download the src package for wget2, and unzip it to
a directory in OSS. The current build instructions used by ITUGLIB are:</p>
<pre>
tar xzf wget2-ssl3.0-2.1.0.tar.gz
CFLAGS="-c11" OPENSSL_CFLAGS="-I/usr/local-ssl3.0/include -L/usr/local-ssl3.0/lib" \
	OPENSSL_LIBS="-lssl -lcrypto" conf_script_floss_cc \
	--prefix=/usr/local-ssl3.0 --with-ssl=openssl
make
</pre>
